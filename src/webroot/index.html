					<h1>Raven's IQ test online</h1>
					<div class="description"><strong>The Raven IQ test</strong> - known more formally as <strong>Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM)</strong> - refers to a nonverbal test that aims to measure an individual's intelligence and abstract reasoning. In other words, it specifically tests for general intelligence, but has a degree of inclination in its focus on fluid intelligence.</div>

				<h2>Test Instructions</h2>
				<p>Now you will be offered a series of graphic drawings. There are 60 of them in total, they are grouped into 5 sets.</p>
				<p>On each individual figure in the upper half of the sheet there is a rectangle that has a certain background or component elements (shapes) interconnected by some kind of dependence. In the lower right corner of the rectangle there is a cutout - a free, empty space.</p>
				<img class="replace-black" src="assets/img/instruction1.png" alt="Task">
				<p>Under the rectangle there are 2 rows of fragments (six or eight), which, in shape and size, exactly fit the cutout of the rectangle. Each proposed fragment has a different pattern.</p>
				<p>Your task is to find in a number of fragments one that would fit exactly into the free space. The prerequisite for a correct decision is a logical reasoning about the law according to which the drawing is drawn in the rectangle, the empty space in which you must fill.</p>
				<img src="assets/img/instruction2.png" alt="Answer">
				<p>Time to solve 60 tasks is limited to 20 minutes. Do not linger on the first tasks of the test, as their complexity increases all the time.</p>
